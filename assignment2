 Problem #2 :  play with directory 

    1#  create a directory without name from command line
    2#  create a directory with name "-okgoogle"

1# mkdir " "
we have to create file without name so we give name of directory is space.
This command will create directory without any name.

2# mkdir -- -okgoogle
when we create directory without giving -- so this command will give error -o option not available.
so we give -- so it will not treat -okgoogle as option.
